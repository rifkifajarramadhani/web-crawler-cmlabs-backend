A digital campaign is considered a marketing activity that is carried out digitally to achieve certain objectives. This activity uses various digital platforms or channels, such as websites, social media, email, online advertising, and other digital content.

To carry out a digital campaign strategy, detailed planning is required, starting with determining campaign objectives, target audience segmentation, developing messages to be conveyed, and selecting the right digital marketing channels. 

Purpose of Running Digital Campaigns

The purpose of running a digital campaign can vary depending on the needs and marketing strategy of the company. The following are some general goals that can be achieved through this campaign:

1. Increasing Brand Awareness

In recent times, the human lifestyle has reared its head to digitalization. This change encourages businesses to use digital channels such as social media, online advertising, and so on.

This digital channel can be utilized to expand the reach of a brand's promotion and marketing as well as introduce it to new potential customers.

2. Increase Engagement and Interaction

Digital media allows the emergence of interesting and interactive content. The existence of various types of content can be used to trigger discussion, get feedback, encourage consumers to actively participate, and engage in two-way communication with brands.

3. Increase Conversions and Sales

One of the main goals of a digital campaign is to generate conversions and sales. This goal can be achieved through designing campaigns to encourage audiences to take the desired action, such as making a purchase, downloading an application, or signing up for a newsletter.

The goals of a digital campaign must be set before it runs. This is intended so that strategies can be designed appropriately, resources are allocated wisely, and results are optimal.

Digital Campaign vs Conventional Marketing

Digital campaigns and conventional marketing have several differences. Here are the main differences between the two:

1. Marketing Channels

a. Digital campaign: Using digital channels such as websites, social media, email, online advertising, and other digital content.

b. Conventional marketing: Involves using conventional channels such as print media (newspapers, magazines, and brochures), television, radio, and billboards.

2. Reach and Targeting

a. Digital campaign: Enables more accurate and specific targeting by targeting audiences based on demographics, interests, online behavior, and other user data. This allows a campaign to reach a more relevant audience and potentially result in a higher conversion rate.

b. Conventional marketing: Usually using conventional channels to convey messages and advertisements to the general audience. This is a little difficult if you want to do more specific targeting.

3. Measurement

a. Digital campaign: Data measurement is more accurate and real-time. From this data, a company can understand campaign performance, identify areas that need improvement, and take the necessary actions precisely and quickly.

b. Conventional marketing: Measurement tends to be more difficult and less accurate because it is done manually. 

Digital Campaign Types

Digital campaigns have various types of digital media with different characteristics. You can try one of the types of digital media below that suits your campaign goals.

1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is the practice of increasing the visibility and ranking of a website in the organic result pages of search engines like Google.

Website optimization activities can be carried out by creating article content that is tailored to keywords that are in accordance with the business field of the website itself or the content needed by the user.

The goal of SEO practice is to get relevant organic traffic to a website in order to increase its authority and ranking on the SERPs in the long term.

2. Search Engine Marketing (SEM)

SEM is a marketing strategy that involves using paid advertisements to increase a website's visibility in search engine results.

Compared to SEO, SEM can help display ongoing campaigns at the very top of the first page of search engine results.

Thus, a website can immediately get greater traffic and exposure.

3. Email Marketing

Email marketing is a promotional tactic that uses email to communicate with the target audience.

It can be said that email marketing is quite an effective method because the promotion or message conveyed is sent directly to the owner of the email.

That way, companies can establish more personal communication with their target audience.

4. Social Media Marketing

Social media marketing is a promotional tactic that uses various social media platforms. Some of these social media are often used in this activity: TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.

The marketing activity focuses on using social media by creating content that can capture the attention of the target audience.

This can trigger discussion, get feedback, and encourage consumers to actively participate with the brand.

The existence of a brand on social media can also make a business seem user-friendly or closer to users.

As a marketer, you can also better understand trends in social media, which can be used to design more effective marketing campaigns.

5. Search Engine Advertising (SEA)

Search engine advertising (SEA) is a type of campaign in the form of paid advertising. Ads optimized by SEA will appear in the first position of the search engine results page.

The concept of SEA is actually more or less the same as SEO, but advertisers must pay a fee for each click from internet users, better known as cost per click (CPC).

Because it is a paid marketing activity, SEA has the advantage of being able to display ads that have been optimized to appear in the first position on the search results page.

Benefits of Digital Campaigns

The use of digital campaigns can have a positive impact on business growth. With this promotional strategy, you can reap some of the benefits below:

1. Reach a Wider Market

Digital campaigns usually utilize digital channels such as websites, social media, email, online advertising, and other digital content.

Through these digital channels, the content can be disseminated quickly and easily, so that it can reach audiences across a wider variety of geographies, demographics, and market segments.

2. Increasing Brand Awareness

Digital channels can be utilized to create interesting and engaging content for audiences.

Through this content, companies can build strong brand awareness and strengthen their brand image in the minds of consumers.

3. Save Marketing Costs

Digital campaign costs can be more economical than conventional marketing. This is because the costs of producing digital content tend to be relatively low, and companies can control their marketing budgets through the existing bidding system that is usually used in digital campaigns.

How to Run a Digital Campaign

To create an effective campaign, several important steps are required. The following is an explanation of how to carry this plan out:

1. Conducting Research with Competitive Analysis

Research with competitive analysis can be done by understanding the market, competitors, and the latest trends.

From this research, you will be able to find out the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors, as well as the opportunities and threats that exist in the market. This analysis will help you create an optimal campaign.

2. Understand Your Business Profile

Understanding your business profile can be done by identifying your unique selling proposition (USP) and target audience for your business.

The two aspects are interrelated. Identifying USPs is used to help you realize what makes your business different from all other businesses.

Through USP identification, you will know which audience will buy products from your business. That way, you will know your target audience from your business profile.

3. Set Expenses for Promotions

Arranging expenditures for promotions can be done by considering the availability of resources and business campaign objectives.

Apart from that, you also need to pay attention to spending on paid advertising, digital marketing tools, and the human resources needed to carry out a successful campaign.

4. Choose a Marketing Channel

Before choosing a marketing channel, make sure who the target audience for your business is. This is very important because every target audience is different and has its own characteristics.

Once you have selected your target audience, you can decide which marketing channels will provide the most visibility and engagement.

5. Creating Content According to the Target Market

After choosing a marketing channel, do some research first to find out what content is most suitable for your target audience.

Make sure your website provides relevant, informative, and engaging content. That way, you can increase the attractiveness and engagement of your audience.

So, that's a complete guide on what a digital campaign is, its types, benefits, and how to do it to improve your business's performance.
