Google News Decides to Remove All Links to Local Canadian News from Its Search Results due to New Regulations

The Government of Canada has recently introduced new regulations requiring digital platforms like Google and Meta (parent company of Facebook) to pay royalties for displaying local news content.



Canada Online News Act

The Canada Online News Act, also known as Canada's Bill C-18, is a new regulation aimed at defining the responsibility of digital platform companies towards local news outlets for the outcomes of their search results.

On June 30th, through its Twitter account, Google made a controversial decision to remove all links to local Canadian news from its search results. This decision was made in response to the new regulations imposed by the Canadian government, which require digital platforms like Google and Meta to pay royalties for the local news content they display.

The regulation by the Canadian government aims to create a balance of revenue between news outlets and digital platforms. Through this regulation, digital platforms are required to pay royalties to news outlets for the use and display of local news content on their platforms. This is the aspect that digital platform companies have contested.

This regulation emerged because the government seeks to support the sustainability of local news outlets, which often miss out on opportunities due to the presence of major digital platforms.

 

Pros and Cons

This regulation has sparked both support and opposition from various quarters. The Canadian Association of Journalists has criticized the move taken by Google, calling it an attempt to restrict freedom of information. They express disappointment in the decisions of Google and Facebook, deeming them a violation of the fundamental principles of an open and free internet.

By closing access to local news, Google and Facebook are seen as assuming the role of dictators, determining what information can be accessed by the Canadian public.

This tweet has also received criticism, as it is considered to "force" Google, a private company, to comply with government regulations that might not be acceptable as a digital platform company.

On the other hand, proponents of the regulation argue that it is a necessary step to ensure that local news outlets receive fair compensation for their content used by digital platforms.

Meanwhile, the Canadian government and Google are currently engaged in discussions to find an appropriate solution.

A similar situation has also arisen in Indonesia with the planned Quality Journalism Presidential Regulation (Perpres Jurnalisme Berkualitas) that requires digital platforms to pay local news companies. In this case, Google has also threatened to take similar action in Indonesia if the regulation is not amended.

Will Google News also leave Indonesia due to this regulation? If the Quality Journalism Presidential Regulation is implemented with provisions deemed detrimental by technology companies like Google, there is a possibility that Google may consider such action.
