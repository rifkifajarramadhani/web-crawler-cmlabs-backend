Key Takeaways

Google and Bing integrate AI into their search engines.

Google introduces the new Search Generative Experience feature.

Bing search engine and Edge browser use AI to enhance search results with simple language queries.



Generative AI in Google

Google has announced the addition of a new generative AI search feature to its search engine. The new feature, called SGE (Search Generative Experience), utilizes artificial intelligence to display more comprehensive search results.

SGE works by understanding the intent of the user's search query. It then generates various types of search results, including text, images, and videos. These results are then presented to the user.

SGE is still in development, but Google states that the technology has proven effective in generating more comprehensive and informative search results.

Google plans to add new features to SGE, such as the ability to generate personalized search results and the ability to display results in multiple languages. Google states that SGE is part of its effort to make search smarter and more useful.

Generative AI in Bing

Microsoft has also announced a new AI-powered version of its Bing search engine and Edge browser. The new versions are designed to be smarter and more helpful, making it easier for users to find the information they need.

One of Bing's key features is its ability to understand natural language questions. This means that users can ask Bing simple English questions, and Bing will understand what they are asking to provide relevant results.

For example, a user can ask "What is the capital of France?" and Bing will be able to provide the answer, “Paris.”

Another new feature of Bing is its ability to provide more comprehensive and informative results. Bing now uses artificial intelligence to analyze website content and deliver more relevant and useful information to users.

For instance, if a user searches for "how to make a cake," Bing will not only provide a list of recipes but also step-by-step instructions, videos, and other useful information.

The Edge browser also includes several new features designed to be smarter and more helpful. One of the key features of the new Edge browser is its ability to learn from user habits.

This means that Edge can personalize the user experience and provide them with more relevant content. For example, if a user frequently visits news websites, Edge can recommend other news websites that the user may be interested in.

The AI-powered versions of Bing and Edge represent significant developments for Microsoft. These products are designed to make it easier for users to find the information they need.
