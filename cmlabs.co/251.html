Niche Keywords: Definition, Benefits, and How to Identify
Niche Keywords: Definition, Benefits, and How to Identify 

Last updated: Mar 07, 2024

What are Niche Keywords?

Niche keywords are a term for keywords that are very specific and lead to certain business areas or industries.

Unlike competitive and general keywords, niche keywords are generally more detailed and have lower competition.

Nonetheless, this type of keyword is generally often considered highly relevant. For example, if "Sports shoes" is a competitive keyword, then "Carbon plate running shoe for heel striker" is a specific keyword.

The main purpose of niche keywords is to attract the attention of the right audience without competing with a large number of companies to increase search visibility, targeted organic traffic, and better conversion rates.

Benefits of Niche Keywords

Using specific keywords in web content will be very beneficial for businesses, especially in the digital marketing world. Here are the benefits you can get from using specific keywords:

 

1. Improve Content Relevance

The use of specific keywords can help strengthen the relationship between the content you present and the target market so that the user experience becomes more meaningful.

In this way, using specific keywords ensures that the content you create is relevant to what the audience is looking for and needs, thus increasing engagement and conversion rate in a business or website.

2. Expanding Audience Reach

Using specific keywords can also help you expand your audience reach, especially those who are interested in a particular topic or business.

These types of keywords can help you draw the attention of audiences who are already interested in what you have to offer, whether it's products or services.

 

3. Reduces Competition

General keywords often have many competitors making it harder for websites to rank in the top search results. Meanwhile, specific keywords can focus SEO efforts on a more targeted market, where the competition tends to be lower.

 

4. Improves SEO Ranking

Search engines tend to pay special attention to content that is relevant to certain keywords. By optimizing your content using specific keywords, you can help your website rank in the top search results.

 

5. Increase Conversion Rate

Increasing conversion rates means encouraging more website visitors to take action, such as buying products, subscribing, and completing contact forms.

By using specific keywords, you can target a more specific and relevant audience, so they are more likely to be interested in what you have to offer.

 

How to Identify Niche Keywords

Now that you understand what niche keywords are and their benefits, here are numerous approaches you can take:

 

1. Define Your Industry Niche

Before deciding on your industry niche, make sure to understand your target audience. Find out what issues they are facing and what solutions are most suitable.

For example, if your customers are struggling to find affordable eco-friendly beauty products, then an example of a relevant keyword would be "affordable eco-friendly mascara."

In addition, it is also important to understand your audience's search intent. For example, general keywords like "full coverage insurance" lack strong intent, but "affordable full coverage insurance for teen drivers" shows clearer intent.

 

2. Conduct Market Research

Conduct market research by seeking information on trending topics within the defined niche through industry publications, podcasts, and webinars.

Also, take a look at competitors and identify patterns in their content. If a topic has been discussed extensively in recent months, it could be an indication that it has the potential to become an interesting keyword.

By continuing to observe and identify competitor patterns, you can find effective niche keywords to broaden your reach and attract the attention of your target audience.

 

3. Competitor Evaluation

The next step in identifying keywords based on a niche is by evaluating your competitors. In this case, look for a business that offers to sell similar products or services to yours.

After compiling a list of competitors, use tools like Google Search Console to identify gaps in their content strategy that can inspire your content creation.

 

4. Discover Online Communities

You can also identify specific keywords by exploring online communities like Reddit, Quora, and Facebook groups.

On these platforms, people are usually looking for answers to specific questions that they might not find through a regular Google search.

 

5. Compare Keyword Metrics

Compare various keyword metrics to find the best choice for your digital marketing campaign. Here are the steps you can take to compare keyword metrics:

Number of Monthly Searches: Consider how often the keyword is searched each month. Choose keywords with at least 100 searches per month.
Keyword Difficulty: Pay attention to the 0-100 scale which indicates how difficult it is to rank top in searches. Choose low-difficulty keywords with a moderate to high number of monthly searches.
Cost Per Click (CPC): You should be aware and notice that high cost per click can eat up your advertising budget quickly. In this case, you can prioritize keywords with low CPC for ad campaigns.
