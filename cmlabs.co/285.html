How cmlabs Keeps SEO Plans & Implementation Gap 

Published at Feb 15, 2022 08:02

Cover image: The illustration of SEO planning done by cmlabs. The plan and implementation sometime create a gap. But, here is how cmlabs keep that gap as close as possible.

Disclaimer: Our team is constantly compiling and adding new terms that are known throughout the SEO community and Google terminology. You may be sent through SEO Terms in cmlabs.co from third parties or links. Such external links are not investigated, or checked for accuracy and reliability by us. We do not assume responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any information offered by third-party websites.

Commonly, a too-good plan has the potential to create a gap with its realization. It even tends to have a negative result. Then, how does cmlabs keep the plan running according to its implementation?

Main Issue

1. When the realization is not as it is planned, the closest loss is unmaximized SEO costs and time;

2. But, indeed, making your own plans is not an easy thing. In the context of SEO planning it requires an in-depth understanding of the technical and business sides;

Introduction

It's true that we still have to prioritize this topic. So far, cmlabs is trying to narrow down the gap between the plans and their implementation, so that it meets the expectation. Of course, we consider it a difficult problem to solve, because of the complex measurement and justification.

Content

So how do we solve this issue? We understand that in SEO, the result is the main goal.

First Layer

In a certain condition, we have to abandon the plans and make new ones achieve the agreed results. Moreover, the business sector such as SEO services become a dynamic place. It depends on the search engines, therefore optimization activities must be done.

Then, our specialists' activities must be reported and need approval from the relevant parties. We always emphasize this activity, so that when the expected process meets the initial plan, we already know it. 

Second Layer

In the next layer, we always make sure that every SEO specialist for a particular client must be the one in charge. As a company that prioritizes quality and results, cmlabs regularly ensures that every team involved in any project must understand that time is the most important investment. If the time is neglected, important moments may be missed. So, material losses will be incurred if this bad habit remains.

Third Layer

In the next layer, the strategic team must have priority over all websites and clients we work for. It will remind us that in a certain period there are clients who do not meet their expectations. So, additional action is needed.

This information will be conveyed by the strategist team through their communication channel and also during our weekly internal meetings.

Fourth Layer

We have individuals who fill mid-management positions. This position has the authority to remind, warn, and carry out special executions which are generally important. cmlabs has a regular schedule every quarter through Town-hall meetings to evaluate the achievements of their respective teams. This agenda allows us to know each other's achievements from teams to individuals or specialists. So, the monitors that we apply are layered and the gap between the plan and the realization can be narrowed.

Content Keywords

seo, seo plan, plan realization, seo specialist, management

Purpose

This is our effort to be more transparent about the SEO process within the team. We will periodically review the work of every team and individual. As an SEO company with long-term goals, we are in the improvement process.
