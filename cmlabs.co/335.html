Alabama is a good place to start if you want to build a business. This is because Alabama is one of the most tax-friendly states in the U.S.

In addition, Alabama is famous for its low-cost living and modest utilities. This can help your financial situation in starting a business. 

Then, how to start a business in Alabama? Learn the tips below.

 

1. Create A Business Concept

The first step of how to start a business in Alabama is to create a business concept. You can identify the value of your business and the goal you want to achieve. 

You can also make a business concept out of your interests, skills, and passions. Equally important, you have to research the market, the strategic location, the business entity you want to be, and the business gap between other businesses in your sector. 

A clear business concept can give you a projection of how your business will run and the funds that you need to establish a business.

 

2. Determining Business Entity

As previously mentioned, determining a business entity becomes one of the most important aspects you need to concept, which is also included in the step of how to start a small business. 

Business entity includes the legal structure matching the goal of your business. Here are some business entities you can choose based on your business:

Limited Liability Company (LLC): LLC is suitable for those who want to establish a direct business with the protection of personal assets. The tax for LLCs in Alabama is quite low and is issued to the owners.
Sole Proprietorship: This type of business is suitable for those who plan to make a business independently. Yet, different from an LLC, a sole proprietorship doesn’t grant liability protection. 
Corporation: In contrast to sole proprietorship, those who want to establish a bigger company can choose a corporation. You can choose S corporation or C corporation which is distinct in taxation status. 
Partnership: Partnership is common for those who want to start a business with one or more partners. Similar to sole proprietorship, this type of business doesn’t grant you asset protection. 

 

3. Register Your Business

After conception and determining the legal structure, the next step of how to start a business in Alabama is to register your business right away. 

If you are an LLC or a corporation, you have to file a Name Reservation form and pay the filing fee of $25. This guarantees that your business name will be reserved so that you can continue completing the registration process to the Alabama Secretary of State. 

Don’t forget to complete the paperwork consisting of business address, purpose, business name, and contact information. This requirement is also included in how to start a business online because some online businesses might need to register the business too. 

 

4. Obtain Permits and Licenses

After registering your business, make sure to apply for permits and licenses. This applies to all types of business in Alabama.  

You can obtain a business license from the Alabama Department of Revenue. Other than business licenses, you can get additional licenses, such as occupational licenses, city business licenses, or sales tax permits. 

 

5. Prepare for Business Bank Account and Taxes

Preparing for a bank account and taxes is the next way how to start a business in Alabama. Creating bank accounts for business can protect your business assets and separate them from your assets. 

Thus, if your business falls in the future, it won't affect your financial health. To open a business bank account, you need an Employer Identification Number (EIN) or Federal Tax ID. You will also use the ID number for paying taxes in the future. 

Regarding taxes, every company in Alabama needs to pay a yearly business privilege tax based on a business’s net worth. The tax ranges from $100 to $15,000 depending on the size of your company. 

 

6. Get Business Insurance

Last but not least, you have to get business insurance to protect your company from liabilities in the future. 

The most common insurance for businesses is general liability coverage, protecting you if clients hold your company accountable for property damage or personal injuries.

In conclusion, understanding how to start a business in Alabama is the primary key to running a profitable business. 

As mentioned above, the business concept is the first thing to do when you want to establish a business. In this case, you must use the best marketing strategies to get the desired revenue. 

As one of the most cost-effective solutions, SEO can help you become the market leader and be the top-of-mind brand in Alabama.
