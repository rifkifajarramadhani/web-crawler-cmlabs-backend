Digital Media Buying

Digital Media Buying is divided into 2 sub-services: Backlink and PR/Branding. Our backlink service is further divided into two categories: Backlinks to National Media and Backlinks to Bloggers.

Backlink to Indonesian National Media is a service designed to enhance your business's reputation through articles published in online media such as Detik.com, Liputan6, CNN, CNBC, Kompas, Tempo, Tirto.ID, The Jakarta Post, iNews, and others. 

This service aims to increase brand awareness and business visibility by providing backlinks to credible sites. We can assist you in creating articles for publication or connecting you with Indonesian national media. The backlink service incurs charges for each targeted keyword. You can utilize this service when facing challenges in improving your site's ranking in search engine results within a specific timeframe.

Backlink to Bloggers is a service aimed at helping your business achieve higher rankings in search engine results through mentions on national blogs. However, we have strict specifications for each placement, including:

Website relevance or having relevant keywords to target.
Domain age.
Article publication activity.
Negative keyword density (minimum below 3%).
Commitment to backlink publication accessible for a minimum of 12 months.
Possessing domain authority aligned with our specifications.

At the domain-wide level, the number of backlinks must align with our competitors' backlink activities. All content used for backlink activities must be written by cmlabs.

PR/Branding is a service that assists your brand in obtaining brand mentions or mentions in top-tier media. This service is intended to enhance brand exposure through positive and relevant narratives tailored to promotional needs.

At a certain level (high backlink activity), the placement process will be spread across various media outlets, such as (a) Bloggers, (b) High-Quality Media, (c) Major Media Outlets, (d) Local Media, (e) User-Generated Content (UGC) Sites, (f) Educational Websites, (g) Government Websites, and others (with strict specifications and measurements for each activity involving any external parties). At this stage, a larger budget is required, and we seek understanding from all parties involved regarding the impact and outcomes.

Please consider the following points regarding our backlink services:

cmlabs does not guarantee that backlink placements will directly impact page rankings in any search engine results.
While we strive diligently with this activity internally, we cannot guarantee what might occur if external teams report backlink activities to Google, potentially resulting in Google penalizing the associated sites. We are not liable if the worst-case scenario occurs.
At a certain level, this activity requires us to distribute backlinks to numerous bloggers, online publishers, and UGC websites to make the backlink activity as organic as possible. In this regard, we may require a larger budget for these backlink placements.
SEO for Political Campaign

SEO for Political Campaign combines all cmlabs services, namely SEO Services, SEO Content Writing, and Media Buying. This package is designed for political campaign activities by presenting content about the party and its candidates, based on their vision, on search engines or in supporting parties and individuals for any political events/campaigns.

Clients may choose to use only one service from the SEO package we offer. However, we recommend clients opt for the complete SEO package to achieve optimal results.

We trust that you have diligently reviewed these Terms of Services. By accessing the website or utilizing cmlabs' services and SEO Tools, you acknowledge and consent to adhere to all applicable regulations and terms.

2. Conversely, if the OKRs seem difficult to achieve, the applicable scheme is as follows:

The cmlabs SEO team will convey concerns and constraints to the marketing team with data as strong evidence to support why they cannot achieve the targets.
Open discussion about the type of penalty to be obtained by the client.
The SEO team will send new OKRs along with the data if necessary.
The cmlabs Marketing team will present the new OKRs and penalty period to the client.

Note: The scheme will be determined within H-60 before the end of the contract period.

Limitations
The penalties outlined below will be enforced if errors originate from the cmlabs team, with a maximum penalty period of 3 months. If OKRs are achieved in the second month of the penalty, cmlabs will cease to provide free SEO & SEO Content Writing  services.
The penalties outlined below will not be enforced if errors originate from the client's side (such as slow response in collaboration and failure to complete technical SEO tasks according to the agreed schedule).
Penalties will not be enforced if the majority of OKRs are successfully achieved at 100% and the remainder reaches a success rate of 90%. For example:
Client A collaborates with cmlabs for 12 months, with the following outcomes:
Objective 1 = 100% achieved
Objective 2 = 100% achieved
Objective 3 = 90% achieved
Objective 4 = 100% achieved
Client B collaborates with cmlabs for 8 months, with the following outcomes:
Objective 1 = 90% achieved
Objective 2 = 100% achieved
Objective 3 = 90% achieved
Objective 4 = 100% achieved
cmlabs cannot impose penalties if the issue is caused by Google algorithm updates.
cmlabs will not issue refunds if there is a decrease in demand/search volume in a niche (cmlabs will provide data to support evidence that demand/search volume has decreased). This condition applies only if:
cmlabs has previously provided alternative SEO strategies but the objectives related to search volume remain unchanged.
cmlabs successfully provides data evidence to support the cause of project failure.

Note: Based on current conditions (updates).

Post-Penalty
If within 3 months of the penalty period (during which SEO & SEO Content Writing services were provided for free), cmlabs still fails to achieve OKRs, cmlabs will offer refunds according to the following conditions:
This offer entails a refund of 10% of the total SEO Service price for 3 months, if the project duration is 8 months.
This offer entails a refund of 20% of the total SEO Service price for 3 months, if the project duration is 12 months.
Refund Simulation
cmlabs will refund the amount based on the number of unmet OKRs.

Example scenario:

cmlabs commits to handling SEO activities for Company X, consisting of SEO & SEO Content Writing  services for 12 months. Monthly project value = IDR 8,000,000.
Breakdown per month = SEO Service IDR 5,000,000; SEO Content Writing  IDR 3,000,000.
Total price for the 12-month project = IDR 96,000,000.
If after the penalty period, 1 out of 3 OKRs remains unmet (below 90%), cmlabs will refund 20% divided by 3 (total number of OKRs), resulting in a refund percentage of 6.7% x 3-month SEO Service price. See the example below:
Package price for 3 months of SEO Service is IDR 15,000,000.
6.7% x 15,000,000 = IDR 1,005,000. Hence, the received refund is IDR 1,005,000.

Note: The refund scenario above applies to the SEO and SEO Content Writing Package because these services are directly responsible for client OKRs. On the other hand, cmlabs does not provide a refund calculation scenario for the SEO Content Writing Service alone as this service does not have specific OKRs.
