1. Create an Operational Website

The first step that needs to be taken for online course promotion is to create a website.

That said, this website is a digital form of your business on the search results page (SERP).

Having a website will help you build brand awareness, which makes it easier for target consumers to visit the business platform.

For that, you need to strengthen the authority of the website by providing information and business contacts that can be contacted by potential applicants.

Provide the information that is as short as possible but dense and strong enough to attract the attention of the target audience.

Make sure your course business website has the following crucial pages:

About Us
Contact
Sales
Product

Optimization of these pages with certain keywords that can be obtained from comprehensive research activities.

2. Do Keyword Research

The use of keywords is the main thing that is found in various SEO activities. From this activity, you can choose keywords to use on crucial website pages.

In addition, the keywords from this research can also be used to create content that fits the business niche.

Content or articles created can be optimized according to SEO rules and help increase website visibility on search results pages.

3. Using Keywords in Content

An educational course marketing strategy using SEO always involves keywords.

Use keywords according to search intent strategically in the content on your website, including in titles, descriptions, paragraphs, and tags.

This will help search engines understand the business topic of the course and increase the chances of your website showing up in relevant search results.

4. Finding Unique Solutions for the Target Market

An educational course marketing strategy needs to take the needs and challenges of your target market into account.

Find out what the audience is looking for in the course business and provide unique solutions that can be offered.

Identify the competitive advantage of your business and explain how your course can meet consumer needs.

5. Create a Mobile-Friendly Website

This ever-evolving digital era has increased the use of smartphones. Make sure your course website is mobile-friendly so that it can be easily accessed on mobile devices.

Every website visit from this mobile device will be considered by Google. The world's largest search engine prioritizes search metrics from mobile devices with a concept called Mobile First Indexing.

This will improve the user experience and help improve the ranking of your website.

To check the mobile friendliness, use the Mobile Friendly Test from cmlabs.

6. Showing Positive Reviews from Students

Testimonials and positive reviews from previous students can be a valuable asset in promoting your course on your website.

Display testimonials from students who are satisfied with the course services in a special section on the website.

Positive reviews can help build the trust of prospective students and increase the credibility of your non-formal education institution in the eyes of the audience.

7. Provide Special Offers

To increase enrollment opportunities and the appeal of your course, consider providing special offers to potential students.

These offers can be in the form of discounts, bonus packages, or special access to additional materials.

Promote this offer through the website and social media to reach a wider audience.

These special offers can encourage potential applicants to convert and help increase brand awareness and interest in your course business.

That's all the information about the education course marketing strategy with SEO that can be applied to ensure long-term business continuity.
