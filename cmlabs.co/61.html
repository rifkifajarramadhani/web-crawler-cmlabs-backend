What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing is an experimental method that analyzes two or more variables and decides which one gives the best result for a website or a business. For instance, several variables that can be tested using the method are the text, elements on pages, or an offer inside the content.

The letter ‘A’ in A/B testing is the original version of the variable being tested. On the other hand, ‘B’ refers to another version from the original. The test is done by comparing the data from each version of the variable. As an example, you can compare the data like sales and lead generation.

The variable that proves to be the most profitable can be implemented on your website. By testing these different variables, you can optimize your website as well as increase the Return on Investment (ROI) of your business.

It is worth noting that in doing the testing, you can only compare minor variables. If the variables are too different, it can make it difficult for you to know which one can affect your customers’ decisions for sure.

The Benefits of A/B Testing

After understanding what A/B testing is, you need to know its benefits. As explained before, the benefit of the testing is to optimize websites or grow business. Here is the explanation about it:

Solve Users’ Problems

When users visit a website, they must have a certain goal to reach. One user may want to purchase something, the others probably just want to know more about the products or your business. Some users perhaps only look for certain content about a specific topic. 

As someone who runs a website, you should make sure that users can reach their goals smoothly. Such bothers like uninteresting copies or confusing CTA buttons can give a bad experience for the visitors and further affect their decisions to purchase the product.

In this case, the function of the testing is to make sure that your website runs optimally. It may help users reach their goals.

Reduce the Bounce Rate

A/B testing can reduce your website’s bounce rate or the percentages of users who visit the website but decide to not explore it further. Instead, they will leave the page not long after opening it.

What causes high bounce rate vary and it can not be compared between one website and another. Hence, it is difficult to find the right solution that should be applied to all websites.

One of the things that you can do is to test several pages that consist of different elements. Afterward, you can see which one has the lowest bounce rate. In doing so, you can find the solution that works best for your website.

Optimizing Website

A website page that goes through the testing will be more optimized than the ones that are not. This can happen since it allows you to build user-oriented websites.

When users feel the benefits of a website, they will stay longer there and explore further. It is possible that they may visit the site again. Surely, such repeated visits will give benefits for websites according to the system of SEO.

Increase the ROI from Traffic

Websites with high traffic will be useless if it does not gain profits for your business. The cost of this SEO activity should reflect the ROI of your business. It is to indicate that the spending is not done for nothing.

No matter what type of SEO strategies you apply, they should contribute to the growth of your business. In this case, one of the functions of the testing is to help users complete their transactions easily. 

The testing can help you find the best format of your website with the highest conversion rate. Some examples of these benefits are the easy transaction process, more attractive copies, or simpler interface designs.

What Types of Elements that Can be Tested?

You know what A/B testing is, as well as its functions and benefits. Next, you must understand which element can be tested using this method. The elements for the testing are any kinds of aspects inside a website’s page. Here are some of them:

Title and Heading: the length, diction, type of font, or language style.
Description: the length of sentence or paragraph, the text, language style, type of font, or the typing format.
Visual Elements (Photos/Illustration): types of visuals, objects, colors, sizes, or numbers.
Layout: its order and length.
Promo/Offer: types of offers and their countdown.
Call-To-Action (CTA): types of CTA (forms or buttons), the colors of the buttons, the length of the forms, or the copy on CTA.
