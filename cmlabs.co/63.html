What is Organic Traffic?

It is the traffic that lands on a website from “organic” or unpaid search results. The ultimate way how to increase organic traffic is by doing the right SEO.

For example, if a user searches for a certain keyword in the search engine, then your website appears as one of the top search results. After reading your article title and meta description, the user is interested in clicking on the link and visiting your website. This kind of traffic is defined as organic ones.

Increasing website traffic does take quite a long time. Search engines will assess the quality of content that deserved to appear at the top of search results. So, it will be difficult for a website to increase it if the website's performance in organic search is not good enough.

Difference between Organic Traffic and Paid Traffic

The thing that distinguishes paid traffic and organic traffic is the cost we spent. The Organic one does not require a fee (free) while paid traffic can only be obtained with paid ads.

Paid traffic is usually obtained from paid ad impressions (paid ads) which can make your website perched on top in a short time. However, this type of traffic has its drawbacks. When you stop paid ads, the ranking will drop significantly and it affects the traffic.

In contrast, even though it takes a long time and effort to increase it, this traffic lasts longer. If your website manages to occupy the top position, then the traffic that will land on the website will increase. So, how to increase organic traffic? The answer is by doing the complete SEO.

Why is Organic Traffic Important?

Internet users tend to visit websites placed in the top 10 websites on the search page. If your content is successfully displayed in the top position, more internet users will visit your website. In that way, you can get unpaid traffic at no cost.

Traffic that comes from the organic channel will make your site recognizable by internet users. If the reach of customers is wider, the popularity of the website will increase. So, you can easily introduce and market the products and services of your business to the right market.

In addition, internet users are also more interested in finding the specific information they need from organic search results than paid ads. The more traffic you get, the higher the conversion rate on your website.

If your site is successful in attracting audiences and providing them with what they need, the chance of the audience following your promo or signing up for your newsletter will be high. These audiences have the potential to become long-term consumers of the products or services you offer.

How to Increase Organic Traffic
On-Page SEO Optimization

On-page SEO is an optimization tactic that is carried out internally on the web. This tactic focuses on improving the quality of the content on your website.

On-page SEO optimization steps that can be done as a way to increase unpaid traffic are as follows:

Create informative and SEO-friendly content
Optimizing internal linking
Pay attention to keyword distribution
Optimize title tag and meta description
Use heading tags for more structured content
And others

If you want to know more about on-page SEO, you can access the complete article on On-page SEO Guidelines.

Use Long-Tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords are keywords that consist of 3 or more words. Usually used to define specific keywords. You can see a full explanation in Long-tail keywords. If you only rely on short keywords to get the top rankings, it will be difficult to achieve because short keywords have a fairly high level of competition because they are widely used by other websites.

Compared to short keywords, long-tail keywords will appear more often in search results because they consist of several keywords at once. Internet users use long-tail keywords to find the specific thing they are looking for. If your website provides them with what they need, the chances of conversion increase.

Long-tail keywords tend to have a fairly low level of competition because there are rarely websites that use these types of keywords. If it is used properly, it can also increase rankings and traffic on your website.

Improve Content Quality

One way to increase organic traffic is by producing high-quality content. Users prefer web pages that are relevant to their search. Therefore, it is important for web owners to use titles and meta descriptions that contain content information to bring in more traffic.

High-quality content can also be a useful source of backlinks for organic traffic. If your site provides useful information, other sites will also refer to you. Even users who are interested in the information will be happy to share it.

Off-Page SEO Optimization

Off-page SEO is one of the optimization techniques carried out outside the website. Aims to increase the trust of search engines and internet users towards your website. A platform that can be used to support off-page SEO optimization such as other sites, social media, and online forums.

How to increase organic traffic through off-page SEO:

Link Building
Content Marketing
Promotion Through Social Media
Make use of the Forum

We have summarized further discussions regarding off-page SEO guidelines for you and it can be accessed at any time through our SEO guidelines.

Optimize PAA (People Also Ask)

Optimizing the SERP feature can make your website appear at the top of the SERP page. The SERP feature displays a snippet of information that internet users are looking for, if it is relevant to their needs, they will visit the related website. It is time for you to add SERP features such as “People Also Ask” as a way to increase organic traffic.

PAA is a search result containing a list of questions other internet users have related to your search. The searched question usually requires a specific answer. The answers can be displayed in the form of paragraphs, lists, tables, to videos.

For those of you who are not familiar with PAA, here we attach an example of PAA on the search results page.

Figure 2: An example of the SERP feature "People Also Ask" on a search engine. When the PAA results are clicked, you can see detailed answers to related questions, accompanied by links to websites that provide answers, as well as options to explore further on the topic of the question.

Use the query type for questions to display PAA features, such as “what”, “why”, “when”, “where”, “who”, and “how”. You should do your research to find content ideas that can win the PAA feature. Make sure to include answers that can encourage users to visit your site.

That is the complete guidelines about what organic traffic is, how important it is, and how to get organic traffic. However, it can not be obtained overnight. Proper SEO implementation and periodic improvements are needed in order to increase rankings and conversions on your website.
