What is off-page SEO?

Off-page SEO is all SEO tactics that are carried out outside the website and are not included in content production activities. The goal of implementing these techniques is to make users and search engines see your site as relevant, credible, and trustworthy.

You might associate this kind of SEO with link building. In fact, practically you can do many other off-page optimization tactics such as content marketing, social media promotion, and forums, which will be discussed further in the following section.

The Importance of Optimizing Off-page SEO

Off-page SEO is one of the determining factors for website ranking on Google. Search engines will consider sites that have high domain authority as trustworthy sites. The users also prefer credible sites to visit and they will be happy to share, leave good reviews, or make your site as a referral.

It can increase your brand reputation and build trust in your domain. Sites with higher domain authority tend to rank better than sites with lower domain authority. Therefore, it is important to optimize the off-page matter to rank better in organic searches.

While link building is not the only off-page technique that determines a site's ranking, it is by far the most important signal. There are several other off-page SEO techniques that will be discussed in these guidelines.

Difference between On-Page SEO and Off-Page SEO

Take a look at the following table to see the difference between on-page SEO and off-page SEO.

On-Page SEO	Off-Page SEO
Optimize SEO-friendly Content	Use Link Building
Title & Meta Tag Optimization	Content Marketing
Optimize Internal Linking	Promote it on Social Media
Add SEO image	Make Use of the Forum
and More	and More

Table 1: Differences between on-page SEO and off-page SEO. Broadly speaking, the table shows the different tactics used in on-page SEO and off-page SEO.

From the table, it can be seen that the fundamental difference lies in the tactics used. On-page SEO techniques applied to your site aim to improve the quality of the content and to make it easier for users and search engines to understand.Â  so that your brand (your domain) can rank better.

While off-page optimization is a tactic used to increase the trust of search engines and internet users in your brand. In contrast to on-page SEO, off-page SEO techniques are carried out with the help of other platforms ranging from other sites, social media, to online forums.

Although they have different optimization tactics, you should make the most of both. Optimizing both on-page and off-page to get better performance in organic search is imperative.

How to Optimize Off-Page SEO

You need to optimize the off-page side for better performance and build domain authority in organic search. Here are some tactics of off-page optimization we recommend:

Link Building

The most important thing in off-page SEO optimization is link building. Link building is a technique to get links from other sites to your site (backlinks). Make sure the backlinks do not come from any random website in order to get high-quality backlinks.

Important Factors of Link Building

There are 4 main factors that you should consider while doing link building:

Authority

Getting backlinks from sites that have high domain authority can help your site rank better in search results. In addition, high-quality backlinks can also increase the credibility of your site.

Topic Relevance

Try to get the backlinks from sites that have relevant topics to your business niche. For example, your business belongs to the technology niche, so you should get backlinks on a website with a technology niche as well. This can help Google identify your page as a relevant site.

However, you can still get backlinks from sites with different topics as long as they are still relevant. In that way, you can also reach a wider audience.

Dofollow link

Dofollow link is a setting to allow search engines to follow the destination link. Of course, it will improve backlink performance because by default it will lead to the destination site. This setting also allows search engines to index the link so that it will have a good influence on the authority of the destination domain.

If you do not want to support the authority of the site that is used as a backlink, you can set it to nofollow or add the rel="sponsored" tag. The rel="sponsored" tag is used for paid links such as advertisements, affiliate links, or content sponsorships.

Traffic

In doing link building, you also need to pay attention to the traffic of sites. If the backlink comes from a site that has high traffic, the potential for clicking on your link will also be greater.

Content Marketing

Content marketing is also important in off-page SEO implementation. Marketing high-quality content to digital channels such as online publishers can boost the visibility of your content. Your website will get a good reputation because it has been mentioned by reputable online publishers.

Examples of content marketing that you can use as an off-page SEO technique are creating and distributing high-quality content, publishing guest posts, and publishing infographics. In addition, content marketing can be done with link building, social media, and advertising media. cmlabs also provides Content Marketing services that can help your brand noticed by a wider audience.

Promote It on Social Media

Another way of off-page optimization is to share the site through social media as a way of promotion. If informative and useful content from your site is shared on social media, many internet users will be interested in visiting the shared post. It certainly brings better traffic to your site.

Even though it does not directly affect the ranking, social media can increase your reputation and make your brand more well-known. Your presence on social media also facilitates communication between you and potential customers.

To get optimal results from social media, you must maintain your visibility, interact and communicate professionally, and make social media a means of branding your business.

Make use of the Forum

Currently, many forums have been abandoned because they are used as a place for backlink spam and website promotion. So, we recommend that you switch from that method and use the forum as a means for discussion with other forum members.

Start answering questions or engaging directly in conversations that match your expertise. That way, you will be seen as an expert in the forum. This can be an effective way to increase the popularity of your site and forum members will provide a backlink to your site.

Online forums that can be used to build relationships and increase audience trust in your website are Kaskus and Quora. In addition, you can also take advantage of online forums that match your niche.

That is the complete guideline about off-page SEO, the difference from on-page SEO, and how to optimize it. The goal of the implementation is to increase the trustworthiness of your site so that it performs better in organic search.

In addition, don't forget to optimize the internal website with on-page SEO. We have provided a complete guide and how to optimize on-page SEO that you can learn in an in-depth approach.
