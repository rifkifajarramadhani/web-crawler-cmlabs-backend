SEO Activities

There are critical SEO activities that must be done by all SEO stakeholders. Here is the detail.

Analyze your brand potential traffic: this is the first thing to do after launching a business website. In this stage, you need to identify the potential competitors whether it is direct or indirect competitors. This can be challenging, moreover when you do it in traditional ways.

Identify potential keywords: Finding what keywords you should use is important to establish feasible goals. However, this analysis needs time and high accuracy. With a helping tool, you can analyze and monitor keywords performance and conduct further research to target your keywords.

Tracking daily ranking: SERP ranking is a dynamic thing, that is why you must keep an eye on it. Tracking and retrieving daily data of your ranking is not an easy way to do. Furthermore, if your business has a lot of keywords to track. Once you get the tracking information, you can analyze the potential reason behind the ups and the downs of your keywords ranking

Local SEO and Internationalization

The challenge will be harder when you come to targeting your business in the market. As a first step, you might want to optimize your business for better local SEO. Local SEO strategy is the way to dominate a certain location for your business. Local SEO will be suitable for SMEs and businesses that focus on a particular area. 

Besides the local SEO, if your business targets a wider market, you will need a multilingual website that targets keywords in both languages. Not all multilingual websites are offered to large-scale businesses. The main goal of owning a multilingual and multiregional website is to localize either the service or product according to the target countries which have access to the web.

If your business is at this level, this will be more challenging since you need to track all your keywords with a certain target region. All teams such as the SEO specialist, marketing team, and writers should collaborate to build a multilingual website to achieve the goal. In this stage, you will really need a helping tool as a medium to execute the SEO plan.

That is why helping users to engage with your website should be the main objective. 

Here are some of the SEO objectives you should set:

Increase organic traffic;

Fix website on-page issue;

Optimize very specific metrics on Google Analytics and Search Console (eg. decrease bounce rate, increase time on page, increase page per session, increase impressions share, gain more clicks, more.

Get conversion and sales;

Become a market leader in a specific business sector 

Increase average ranking from all the targeted keywords

How Much do You Need to Have Working SEO Strategy?

Now you know how complex and urgent SEO is for your business. So, how much do you need to have a working SEO strategy? The answer will vary. 

At mid-level, the budget for SEO services in Southeast Asia markets is around $3000-$5000 or IDR 45.000.000 to 75.000.000. These markets involve startups and enterprises with a total market volume is about 50.000 to 150.000 visitors a month.

Based on our marketing team's calculation of the Indonesia market, here is how much you need to spend on SEO services per month:

Low level: $1500-$3000

Mid Level: $2500-$4000

High Level: $3000-$10000 

Those prices will be different in every country, but we just want to show the approximate budget you need in Asian countries. 

Should You Have an In-house SEO Team or Outsourcing?

Since you know how important it is to use your budget efficiently, you need to consider this matter. Think about how you will have an SEO team to help you achieve your business goal. If your business is stable enough to hire an SEO team (SEO specialists, SEO content writers, and developers), then you might want an in-house SEO team. 

However, look at the budget you will spend to have a complete in-house SEO team. Our team has calculated the approximate budget for building a junior SEO team, you will need around IDR 16 million per month. Potentially more or less,  depends on the company's negotiations with prospective employees. While, for the mid-level SEO needs, the total investment of the SEO team is IDR 23 million per month.

In certain scenarios, the internal team will be more profitable for the company. For example, when the company has a plan to make a product or launch a certain service on a regular basis in a certain period. In this scenario, outsourcing costs will be more expensive.

On the contrary, if you do not need a lifetime SEO plan, outsourcing an SEO team will be more efficient and effective for more business sectors, even across all business levels. You can focus on developing the company's business and managing other things for a bigger purpose. Assign your company's SEO work to the experts, and give your valuable time so that the business can develop. 

Conclusion

All in all, implementing SEO for business is worth the investment. It is the long-term benefits that make it imperative. Helping search engine users to find what they are looking for while offering your business is a noble duty you should carry. So, if you are able to provide high-quality content based on your targetted keywords, you will most likely dominate the search engine results.

SEO can be more complex than what we explain above. It means that it needs special treatment and high-level accuracy. It is your time to make use of the SEO tool that helps you do better SEO.
