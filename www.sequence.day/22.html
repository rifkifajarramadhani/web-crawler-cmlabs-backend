Keyword Research 101: An Overview of The Basics

It is better to start this discussion with basic knowledge about keyword research. Here are the basic things you should know about keyword research.

What is Keyword Research?

Keyword research is one of the SEO activities done to find and analyze the most relevant search terms used by many internet users when they are looking for something. This is an important part of search engine optimization and a starting point for any plan within the project.

Doing keyword research will uncover valuable information about keywords such as the popularity, potential, rank difficulty for those keywords, and many more.

The Importance of Keywords in Targeting the Right Audiences

Keywords are very important to help you get in front of the right audience. Users use their keywords to find the results, so if your website manages to appear as their results you will get more traffic.

Another importance of keywords in SEO is to provide insight into marketing trends in a relevant topic so that you can create high-quality content about it. That way, a relevant audience will find your site easily. 

Once you have targeted the right keywords, you have the potential to rank better in your market. After you have a pretty good rank, the traffic will increase too. This is because users tend to visit the first page results rather than the next.

The Main Types of Keywords

Since keywords determine the success of SEO strategy, you have to find the best one. There are many kinds of keywords you should know. Every keyword type target a different audience and intent, so you better know all the types. Here is the introduction.

Short-tail Keywords

As mentioned in the name, short-tail keywords are keywords that are short or around three keywords or less. This keyword type usually has a big amount of search volume but also high-rank competition. 

Shor-til keywords are used to catch a common topic that is more general. For example, a user might type "car" to begin their search about the type of car, the prices, the colors, or any other general information. Targeting short-tail keywords is hard to convert because there is no clear intent at the beginning

Long-tail Keywords

This is the opposite of short-tail keywords. It is formed by three words or more. The longer the keywords, the more specific the results. That is why long-tail keywords have a lower search volume but are less competitive than short-tail keywords. 

This kind of keyword is good to target an audience with specific intent and needs. For example, a user will type “the best SEO service for SMEin Malang” ad what they want to see is the list of SEO services with that specification. 

That is why it is easier to detect the search intent of long-tail keywords and often the users are ready to make a purchase. 

LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) Keywords

The next type is LSI keywords which refer to the keywords that are closely related to the seed keywords. For example, your keywords are “SEO service”, the LSI keywords can be “how to choose an SEO service”, “what to look for in SEO service”, and others.

LSI keywords are often used to create a broader theme and target all possible queries related to the main keywords. To find this type of keyword, you need to conduct a comprehensive keyword analysis and look at the suggested search on the SERP. 

The search volume is usually quite low and so is the competition rate. These characteristics can be used to boost content ranking and catch a more specific search.

Why Keywords Relevance, Search Volume, and Competition Matters

You cannot target any keywords related to your business niche arbitrarily. You have to consider some keyword metrics to get the best potential keywords for your page. 

Relevance, search volume, and competition are three main things to consider when you do keyword research. These three metrics define how you prioritize the topics, observe the trends, and estimate the traffic.

The relevance metrics should be the foremost consideration. You need to be in line with both your business and what people are searching for. Set your target keywords for the most relevant keywords. 

About the search volume and the competition, you better target the high search volume with low competition. That way, you have the potential to rank high and drive more traffic. But, if you only consider the keyword based on the search volume, then you neglect the possibility of low ranking because you compete with huge competitors. 

It is that important to consider the three metrics above or your SEO effort will be in vain.
