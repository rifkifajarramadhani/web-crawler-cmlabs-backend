Rank Dashboard Description

Rank Dashboard Description
Rank Dashboard Description

Rank Dashboard displays the daily ranking of keywords in both desktop and mobile SERPs. You can view your keyword ranking history because Sequence stores the data since the first time you added a keyword. There is also a ranking distribution of all tracked keywords, making it easier for you to know the distribution of keyword rankings.

Our system provides a fairly complete data analysis. You can find out the SEO metrics of each keyword being tracked from SERP feature data, search volume, cost per click, competition (index value), and others. Knowing SEO metrics will help you find solutions to improve the quality of the implemented SEO.

The following guide is structured to help you identify the components found on the Rank Dashboard and Keyword Details pages in Sequence.

Rank Dashboard

The first page you will see after selecting a team is the Rank Dashboard. On this page, Sequence displays a list of your team's keywords, keyword ranking data, keyword metrics, and ranking distributions in attractive and easy-to-understand visual data.

To reload data next to the currently displayed keyword, you can simply press the “Refresh Data” button at the top right of the Keyword Metrics. This button serves to display the latest data results from each keyword.

You can customize the workspace appearance through the Settings menu in Sequence. There is an option to enable dark or light mode for your workspace. In addition, you can also set the use of language whether it is Indonesian or English.

The following is an explanation of the components contained in the Rank Dashboard:

1.Keyword List

On the left side of the Rank Dashboard, Sequence displays a list of the keywords your team is tracking. You can pin keywords that are considered important so that the system will put them in the top position to make it easier for you to monitor these keywords. You can also see the keyword details by pressing the next icon on the right side of the keyword.

2. Keyword Rank

One of the main features of Sequence is that it displays the ranking of the keywords being tracked on the SERPs. The system will automatically display the ranking summary of each keyword for the last 7 days (according to the time zone set on each team).

For example, when you have two teams with different time zones, team A (GMT+7) and team B (GMT-11). Let’s say you open the rank dashboard page on February 8, 2022, at 07.00 (GMT+7), then the rank dashboard for the two teams will display different data.

In team A (GMT+7), you will see keyword ranking data from February 2 to 8, 2022. Meanwhile, in team B with a slower time of 18 hours (GMT-11), you will only see ranking data from 1 to 8 February 7, 2022, because currently in team B (GMT-11) it has not yet entered the date of February 8th.

With Sequence, you can display keyword rankings based on organic or absolute rankings by pressing the option at the top of keyword rankings.

If you select organic ranking, then the system will only show ranking based on organic search results. However, if you select absolute ranking then the system will display the ranking based on the order of paid search results and organic search results.

Figure 2 - Filter data by ranking type.

You can also display keyword rankings based on the selected date by pressing the date option at the top. Then, the system will display the keyword ranking on the selected date up to 6 days before the data. To go faster, press the navigation previous/next to display the data for the past 7 days (according to the time zone set on each team).

Figure 3 - Filter data by specific time period

In this keyword ranking section, we provide different color indicators for each range of ranking values. You will see data related to the day and date of tracking, the average value of keyword rankings plus the signs of increasing or decreasing rankings compared to the previous day, as well as daily ranking data for each keyword for the last 7 days (according to the time zone set on each team).

The calculation of the average daily ranking of keywords is obtained from the sum of the keyword ranking values ​​divided by the number of keywords, without including non-ranking keywords. For example, if you have 10 keywords that are tracked and today 6 of them are ranked, then we will calculate the average ranking from the sum of those ranking values ​​divided by the number of keywords that are ranked, which is 6.

You can also see the average keyword ranking value with an arrow icon on the left side that shows the average change in ranking compared to the previous day. An increase or decrease in ranking is determined by calculating the difference between the previous day's average and today's rating.

If the results of the calculation of the difference in the average rating display a positive value, the arrow icon will be green, indicating that the average rating has increased. On the other hand, if the difference is negative, it means that your average rating has decreased, which is indicated by a red arrow icon.

3. Keyword Metrics

In addition to displaying the ranking of keywords, on the rank dashboard you can also see the SEO metrics for each keyword. SEO metrics allow you to measure the effectiveness of the SEO that has been implemented and help you determine corrective steps based on the data presented to improve your business performance.

You can customize the displayed metrics by pressing the checklist on the selected metrics. The system limits users so that they can only display 5 metrics out of a total of 9 metrics. If you want to choose other metrics, then remove the checklist in the previous selection first.

We provide a brief explanation so that users understand better the keyword metrics contained in Sequence.

Competition (Index Value): This shows how competitive the competition is on the keywords used. The value range of the competition (index value) is low, medium, and high. This value is also determined by competitors who share the same market. The more competitors with high domain authority share the same keywords, the higher the competition value for these keywords will be.

Keyword Tag: Grouping keywords based on the label you give to them. It allows you to observe the keyword separately on the View feature.
