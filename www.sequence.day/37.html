Initially, in the past, PageRank held a prominent position in discussions related to SEO. It served as a widely recognized metric that gauged the effectiveness of SEO strategies, especially those related to building and managing links.

However, as time progressed and the landscape of SEO evolved, the mention of PageRank in contemporary conversations became notably scarce. Despite its reduced visibility, this article will uncover how PageRank still affects ranking and SEO. 

Google PageRank was an algorithm developed by Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, at Stanford University in the late 1990s. Google PageRank is a link analysis algorithm developed by Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, in the late 1990s. It was designed to assess and quantify the importance of web pages based on the structure of the World Wide Web.

The core concept behind PageRank is to view links between web pages as a form of endorsement or vote. In other words, if a page is linked to by many other pages, it is considered more important and, by extension, more likely to be relevant and valuable to users. 

The algorithm aimed to provide a method for ranking web pages that went beyond simple keyword analysis.

How Does PageRank Work?

Here are some key aspects of Google PageRank:

Link as a Vote

PageRank treats each hyperlink from one page to another as a vote of confidence. The idea is that if a page links to another, it is essentially endorsing or vouching for the content on that linked page.

Weighted Votes

Not all votes are equal. The importance of a page casting a vote is determined by its own PageRank. A link from a page with a high PageRank carries more weight than a link from a page with a low PageRank.

Page Importance

The algorithm assumes that a page is important if it receives many votes from other important pages. This recursive quality helps establish a hierarchy of importance across the web.

Iterative Algorithm

PageRank employs an iterative algorithm to calculate the importance of each page. The process involves multiple iterations, with each iteration refining the PageRank values assigned to pages until they stabilize.

Damping Factor

To model the behavior of a web surfer who might randomly stop clicking links and initiate a new search, a damping factor is introduced. This factor introduces a probability that a user will jump to a random page rather than follow a link.

No Personalization

Importantly, PageRank, in its original form, did not take into account user-specific information or personalization. It focused on the overall link structure and importance of pages.


It's worth noting that while PageRank was a revolutionary concept and played a crucial role in Google's early success, the landscape of search has evolved. Google no longer updates the visible PageRank scores for websites, and other factors such as content relevance, quality, and user experience have gained prominence in determining search rankings. 

However, the fundamental idea of assessing page importance through link analysis has persisted in various forms in contemporary search engine algorithms.

Does Google Still Use PageRank?

Yes, Google still uses PageRank as part of its ranking algorithm, although it's not quite the same as it was back in the early days of the search engine. Here's a breakdown:

The original PageRank:

Developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, it analyzed the link structure of the web to determine the "importance" of a page.

Pages with more backlinks from high-quality websites would have a higher PageRank score, leading to better search rankings.

This simplicity made it powerful and innovative, but also susceptible to manipulation through link schemes.

PageRank today:

While Google doesn't publicly disclose the exact details of its ranking algorithm, they've confirmed that PageRank is still a factor.

It's incorporated within E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), a framework Google uses to assess website quality.

Backlinks, the core of PageRank, remain an important signal of authority and relevance, but not the only one.

Google incorporates over 200 other ranking factors, including content quality, user engagement, mobile-friendliness, and technical SEO.

So, while PageRank alone doesn't determine your ranking, it's still a valuable piece of the puzzle. However, there is no way to check the PageRank score today as it was removed from the Google Search Console. 

Suggested Practices to Improve Website Rank

To make your site rank better in the search engine despite the changes in the PageRank algorithm, here are suggested practices:

1. Prioritize Exceptional Content

Create genuinely valuable, informative, and engaging content that addresses user needs and interests. Here is what you need to note:

Conduct thorough keyword research to understand what people are searching for and align your content accordingly.

Present information in a clear, well-structured, and easy-to-digest format.

Regularly update and refresh content to maintain relevance and freshness.

2. Foster The E-E-A-T

Establish yourself or your brand as a credible and authoritative source in your niche.

To do that, you have to demonstrate expertise through author bios, credentials, and citations of reputable sources. Not to mention, ensure factual accuracy and maintain high editorial standards.

3. Build High-Quality Backlinks

Next, focus on earning backlinks from reputable websites with relevant audiences. Engage in guest posting, outreach, and collaborations to build relationships with other websites.

One of the effective ways is to create content that naturally attracts links, such as in-depth guides, research-backed articles, or unique tools. Avoid spammy or manipulative link-building tactics that could harm your site's reputation.

4. Optimize Technical SEO

Technical SEO is done to ensure your website is crawlable and indexable by search engines. Here is the checklist:

Improve site speed and performance for a seamless user experience.

Implement mobile-friendliness for optimal viewing on all devices.

Address any technical issues like broken links or duplicate content.

5. Leverage Social Signals

One other way to generate links is through promoting your content on social media to drive traffic and engagement. Encourage shares, likes, and comments to amplify your reach.

This way, you can build a strong social media presence to foster brand awareness and community.
