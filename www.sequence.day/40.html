On-Page Audit

One of the key components of a comprehensive site audit is content analysis. This involves evaluating the quality and relevance of the content on your website, as well as checking for duplicate content. 

Quality and Relevance

The quality and relevance of your content are critical to the success of your website. Your content should be well-written, informative, and follow SEO best practices. 

It should also be relevant to your target audience and address their specific needs and interests. When conducting a content analysis, you should evaluate the quality and relevance of your content, and make any necessary updates or revisions to improve its effectiveness.

Duplicate Content

Duplicate content can be a major issue for websites, as it can negatively impact search engine ranking and user experience. During your content analysis, you should check for any instances of duplicate content, and take steps to remove or consolidate it as necessary.

Page Performance

The next metric is page performance. This is necessary since you need to know how the website performs in achieving its goal. 

The page performance report should tell the website's condition such as good condition, need improvement, or poor. Not to mention, the core web vitals should be reviewed to see how good the site is in supporting user experience.
