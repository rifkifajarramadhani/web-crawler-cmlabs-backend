What Is Website Content Audit?

A website content audit is an essential process that involves evaluating the content on a website to determine its effectiveness and relevance. It is an important action for website owners who want to improve the quality of their content, user experience, and overall website performance.

By conducting a website content audit, website owners can identify outdated or irrelevant content, optimize their content strategy, and ensure that their website meets the needs of their target audience. 

This practice can also help website owners to improve their website's search engine rankings, increase website traffic, and boost user engagement through content.

Content Audit Metrics

To have a guided website content audit, you need to make sure that you target the right metrics. In this part, we will provide you with a list of the key metrics to analyze during a content audit, and show you how to use them to improve your website.

Meta Information

Meta information refers to the HTML elements that provide information about a web page to search engines and users. When conducting a content audit, it is important to analyze the meta information on each page of your website, including the page title, description, and keywords.

Make sure that the meta information is relevant to the content on the page, includes your target keywords, and is compelling enough to entice users to click on your link in search results.

We suggest you be aware of the length. Make sure that it is long enough to describe the content and fit the SERP space. Use Title and Meta Description Checker to make it right.

Keyword Density

The next metric is Keyword density. It refers to the number of times a keyword appears on a page in relation to the total number of words. While it is important to include keywords in your content, overusing them can harm your website's search engine rankings. 

Make sure that the keyword density on each page is reasonable and does not appear unnatural. Before that, make sure that you have targeted the right keyword through keyword research process. 

Readability

Readability is a metric that measures how easy it is for users to read and understand the content on a page. When analyzing readability, consider factors such as sentence length, paragraph length, and the use of headings and subheadings. 

Make sure that your content is easy to scan with clear headings and short paragraphs that make it easy for users to find the information they need. Sometimes, readers do skimming to find the answer to their questions. Thus, readability is essential for website content site audits.

URL

The URL of a page is an important factor in determining its relevance to search engines and users. When conducting a content audit, analyze the URLs of each page on your website to make sure they are relevant, descriptive, and easy to read.

Images

Images can improve the user experience on your website, but they can also slow down page load times if they are not optimized. It is important to include images in your content audit. Analyze the images on each page to make sure they are relevant, high-quality, and properly optimized.

Links

Links are an important factor in determining a page's relevance and authority. Analyze the in-link and out-link when you conduct a website content audit. That way, you can make sure they are relevant, high-quality, and properly optimized.

Page Speed

Page speed is a critical factor in determining a website's overall performance. You need to analyze the page speed of each piece of content on your website and identify any factors that may be slowing it down. Next, make sure that the content can be loaded fastly both on desktop and mobile devices.

Website Content Audit Strategies

After knowing the website content audit metrics, you need to understand the next steps to proceed with your findings. In this section, we will show you how to build a working strategy after you conduct a website content audit. 

Review Content Goals

Reviewing content goals will be best if it's done before the audit. Ask yourself What do you want to achieve with your content? Who is your target audience? What kind of content performs best on your website? Understanding your content goals will help you identify which metrics to prioritize during your content audit.

Categorize Your Content

Categorization allows you to identify which types of content are performing well and which ones need improvement. Consider categorizing your content by type (e.g. blog posts, product pages, landing pages), topic, and format (e.g. text, images, video).

Create Action Checklist

Creating an action checklist is a crucial step in conducting a content audit. The checklist should include specific actions that you need to take to improve your content. 

For example, if you find that some of your content is missing a meta description, you may need to update it. If you find that some of your content is performing well, you may need to create more content in the same vein.

Prioritize Action Items

Once you have created your action checklist, it is important to prioritize the items on the list. Prioritization allows you to focus on the most important items first, so you can optimize your content more effectively based on the website content audit result.
